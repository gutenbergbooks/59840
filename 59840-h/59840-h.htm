<p>At the observation point a self-guiding trail begins which will take
you down and around the &ldquo;Island&rdquo; in the Canyon. There is a drop of 185
feet by ramp and stairway to the &ldquo;Saddle.&rdquo; From there the trail is comparatively
flat, and completely encircles the &ldquo;Island&rdquo; at the level of
the ruins. You will visit several, and be able to see more than 100 of the
400 small cliff dwellings of Walnut Canyon.</p>
<p>Numbered markers along the trail refer to paragraphs in this booklet
which explain features of interest at each marker. When you come to
numbered markers please read the paragraph with the corresponding
number.</p>
<p>Please watch your step at all times. The total length of the trail is
five-eighths of a mile and the average time consumed is 40 minutes.</p>

<p>General view of canyon. From this point
you will observe that the canyon makes a large &ldquo;horse shoe&rdquo; bend leaving
an &ldquo;Island&rdquo; connected to this side by the narrow neck of land we call the
&ldquo;Saddle.&rdquo; It is in this small section of the canyon that there is the heaviest
concentration of prehistoric cliff-dwellings.</p>
<p>From here you are able to discern the distinctly different types of
vegetation growing on opposite sides of the canyon. On the north side
(or southern exposure) we see many of the desert type plants native to
southern Arizona. On the other side we have the types common in the
higher and colder elevations.</p>
<p>Walnut Creek, the stream which cut the canyon, was dammed in
1904 to form Lake Mary which supplies the city of Flagstaff; otherwise
there would be a running stream in the canyon today. The early Pueblo
Indians probably picked the canyon for their homes for this reason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>They farmed the mesa tops. The natural caves formed by erosion
furnished ideal roofs, as well as protection from enemies and comparatively
easy access to domestic water supply.</p>
<p><i>You will now take the trail, to your left, which will lead you to the
next stake at the &ldquo;Saddle.&rdquo; The trail is steep and there are several flights
of stone steps. It is quite safe, but we urge you to use care in your descent.</i></p>
<h3 id="c3">STAKE NO. 2.</h3>
<p>Looking down canyon (to your left) is a
graphic view of the geological formations exposed in Walnut Canyon. On
the <a href="#Page_3">next page</a> of this guide leaflet are sketches showing &ldquo;How the
Canyon was Formed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>No. 1.</b> Millions of years ago this area was a vast flood plain near
sea level. Shifting sands were formed into dunes by wind causing cross
bedding or lamination. It is these sands that form the Toroweap
Formation which is the oldest exposed in the canyon and is the whorled
and cross-bedded sandstone which rises from the Canyon floor.</p>
<p><b>No. 2.</b> Later this flood plain was submerged, and for millions of
years was at the floor of a large, shallow body of water called &ldquo;The Permian
Sea.&rdquo; Calcium carbonate was precipitated to the floor of the sea. Small
sea animals were trapped or covered by this ooze or mire which later
compacted into stone and forms the Kaibab Limestone which forms
the rim of the canyon, and rests directly on the Toroweap. Many marine
fossils are found in this formation.</p>
<p><b>No. 3.</b> A gradual uplifting of the earth&rsquo;s surface caused the sea to
retreat. Streams draining the land began cutting channels to the sea. The
gradual uplift coupled with the cutting action of the stream facilitated
canyon cutting. Erosion carried away later Cretaceous deposits from the
rim and side erosion began widening the channels. Softer strata would
erode more rapidly than the hard, forming the caves in which man later
built his homes.</p>
<p><b>No. 4.</b> Volcanic activity and the forming of the San Francisco
Peaks during the next period increased erosion. This activity has continued
until fairly recent times. The latest eruption was that of Sunset Crater,
occurring around 1066 A.D. Walnut Canyon was dammed to form Lake
Mary in 1904. Otherwise there would be running water in the canyon
most of the year.</p>

Walnut Canyon. In summer the Coral King Snake with colorful
black, white, and orange-red bands may be seen. This snake is
harmless and should not be disturbed.</i></p>

<h3 id="c4">STAKE NO. 3.</h3>
<p>Although not the best preserved of
the ruins you will visit, this once was an extensive string of rooms. By tree
ring dating we have been able to establish dates of occupancy&mdash;the earliest
for these masonry dwellings being 1120 A.D. They were abandoned
between 1200 and 1300 A.D.</p>
<p>Near the center of the room is what remains of an ancient fireplace&mdash;almost
obliterated&mdash;so please do not walk on it. From here numerous
rooms may be seen on this side of the canyon and directly across.</p>
<h3 id="c5">STAKE NO. 4.</h3>
<p>Ponderosa or western yellow pine
(also known by 22 other common names) (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>). The leaves
or needles occur in groups of three and are 5 to 11 inches in length. These
trees reach an age of from 350 to
500 years and are considered the
most important lumber tree in the
Rocky Mountain region. Pueblo
Indians of today invariably use
Ponderosa for their kiva ladders.
Hopi Indians attach the needles
to prayer plumes to bring cold.
The needles are also smoked ceremonially.</p>

<p>Douglas
Fir (<i>Pseudotsuga taxifolia</i>). This
tree requires more moisture than
is found on the south slopes of
the canyon. The wood is harder,
stronger, and more durable than
Pine. Douglas Firs are the conspicuous
trees on the slopes
facing north, while Pinyon and
Juniper are dominant on those
facing south.</p>
<p>The boughs of this tree are
used by many Pueblo Indians
today in their ceremonies and
dances, particularly by the Hopi who travel long distances to collect the
branches for their &ldquo;Kachina&rdquo; dances. They believe that the color of the
needles in the early spring will foretell growing conditions for the coming
year. It probably had similar uses among the cliff dwellers.</p>

<h3 id="c7">STAKE NO. 6.</h3>
<p>This fine overhanging ledge furnished
what appears to be an ideal house
site, although apparently it was
never used as such. Perhaps the
women would gather here in the
shade on hot days to chat and
grind their corn or make pottery.
Undoubtedly, Indian children
have played in its cool protection.</p>
<p>The ledges of this type were
used by prehistoric Indians because
they afforded good watertight
roofs for their homes which
could be completed by construction
of walls only in front and on
the sides. The recesses were
formed by a process called differential
weathering or exfoliation.
Moisture seeps into the cracks
behind the surface of the softer
layers of limestone. When the
water freezes it expands, cracking
off thin layers of rock.</p>
<h3 id="c8">STAKE NO. 7.</h3>
<p>Elderberry
(<i>Sambucus corulea neomexicana</i>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
The blueblack berries of this plant
are eagerly consumed as food by
birds and small animals. Berries
are put to present-day use in
making jams, jellies and pie.</p>
<h3 id="c9">STAKE NO. 8.</h3>
<p>This site
once contained five rooms, of
which only a few walls are left.
You will notice that the vegetation
here is different. You are on
the northwest side of the &ldquo;Island,&rdquo;
which receives little sun, is colder,
and has vegetation found in the
great forests of the northern
United States.</p>

<p>These are
the best preserved

has been done around
the doorways, using a dark mud
to distinguish it from the original.
The black soot deposit on the
ceilings is the result of using pitch
Pine for fuel. If you look closely
at the inside walls of this room you will see the handprints of the women
who plastered it&mdash;prints placed here long before America was discovered.
Since so many people wish to see them, we ask that you do not touch the
wall; otherwise in a few years the handprints would be completely
obliterated.</p>

<h3 id="c11">STAKE NO. 10.</h3>
<p>Yucca
(<i>Yucca baccata</i>). Also known as
&ldquo;Soapweed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spanish Bayonet.&rdquo;
This plant was most important
in the economy of the early
cliff dwellers. It furnished all of
the necessities of life, namely food,
shelter, and clothing. The Yucca
is pollinated by a small moth
whose larv&aelig; feed on the seeds.
The Indians prized the fruit,
buds, flowers, and stalks for food.
Its fiber was used for baskets,
mats, cloth, rope and sandals.
Leaves were sometimes laid across
rafters or vigas in buildings and
covered with mud for roofs. The
root makes good soap.</p>

<p>In the construction of houses it
is believed that women did much
work, certainly the plastering, and
possibly the laying of stones in
mortar. Men must have helped
with the heavier &ldquo;hod-carrying,&rdquo;
timber-lifting, etc. Women also
took care of household duties,
made the pottery, and helped with
the farming. The men did the
hunting, weaving, and farming,
and took care of the religious
ceremonies and duties. As with
their descendants, the historic and
present day Pueblo Indians, they
were probably matrilineal, that is,
the children followed the mother&rsquo;s
clan.</p>

<p>Please note the small opening
above the door. The fireplace
was built near the center of the
room and the smoke escaped
through this hole. The T-shaped
doorway gave access to the room,
and was easily covered during cold weather with a skin, mat, or slab of
rock. Each room may have housed a family of four or five. They built
terraces, in front of each set of rooms, which served as door steps. The
rooms may seem small, but most of the every-day hours were spent outside,
and they perhaps used the houses only for cooking and sleeping
during inclement weather.</p>

<p>Little remains
of these rooms
but piles of rubble. Most of the
damage was done by vandals.
Portions of only two walls are
standing, but directly across the
canyon from this point you will
see a dwelling in an excellent
state of preservation. Originally
the walls were covered with plaster
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
so that none of the masonry
was visible. Apparently the balanced
rock on the rim above this
room did not frighten the Indian
builders. Rooms built on two
separate levels of the cave to the
left of this site gave it the appearance
of a two-story dwelling.</p>

<p>Walnut Canyon National Monument takes its name from the Black
Walnut trees found at the bottom of the canyon. It is unusual to find them
at an elevation of nearly 6,700 feet.</p>
<p>The National Monument was established by proclamation of President
Woodrow Wilson on November 30, 1915, to protect the ancient cliff
dwellings of a vanished people. These remains are of great educational,
ethnological, and other scientific interest and it is the purpose of the
National Park Service to preserve them as near as possible in their original
state. Small sections of fallen walls have been repaired and some of the
mud plaster or mortar replaced, but no room is more than 10 per cent
repaired.</p>
<p>The cliff dwellings were discovered by pioneers and in 1883 James
Stevenson visited Walnut Canyon for the Smithsonian Institution. For
many years the main road from Flagstaff to Winslow, now Highway 66,
ran within a few rods of Walnut Canyon and brought numerous visitors
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
even in horse and buggy days. Promiscuous digging in Indian ruins, &ldquo;pot
hunting,&rdquo; was then a popular pastime, and the remains of Walnut Canyon
suffered from thoughtless individuals who were seeking relics.</p>
<p>In 1921 Dr. Harold S. Colton, director of the Museum of Northern
Arizona, made a survey of the cliff dwellings in Walnut Canyon and
located 120 sites, which include more than 400 rooms. Perhaps not all the
rooms were occupied at the same time but conservative estimates place
the maximum population at 500 to 600 Indians.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">WHY THE INDIANS LIVED IN WALNUT CANYON</span></h2>
<p>It is believed that a permanent stream was found in Walnut Canyon
when the Indians built their homes. Walnut Canyon is about 400 feet deep
and the Indians lived about half way down the side. This required a lot of
arduous climbing whenever they went for water, to gather fire wood, to
cultivate the fields, or to meet any of their daily needs.</p>
<p>It appears that the Indians&rsquo; choice of a homesite in the canyon was
guided mainly by where they found natural caves, which might explain
why the Indians selected this particular part of the canyon rather than
some spot a few miles up or down the stream. Here, too, the main canyon
could be entered from a side canyon leading in from the north and emerging
practically on the level where most of the cliff dwellings are found.
Perhaps the Indians first chose the caves which received the most sunlight
in winter, because of the warmth that was gained. As the settlement grew,
some families were obliged to live in the less desirable caves which remained
shaded throughout the cold days of winter.</p>
<p>Not only was there water and natural shelter in Walnut Canyon, but
there was tillable land near the canyon rim where crops would mature
without irrigation. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and
the crops seen from Highways 66 and 89 depend upon rainfall. The cliff
dwellers were farmers, as shown by the remains of beans, squash, and the
corn cobs found in their homes. Several varieties of both corn and beans
were produced.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CLIFF DWELLERS AS FARMERS</span></h2>
<p>Soil near the canyon&rsquo;s rim is too shallow and rocky to produce good
crops, but by traveling two or three miles to the north, land could be found
where the soil is deep enough to retain moisture. Here seeds could be
planted with a sharpened stick and
tended with a stone hoe. No doubt the
cliff dwellers had summer camps near
these fields where dark-eyed watchers
maintained constant vigil to keep
away birds and squirrels seeking to dig
up the seeds, and later, the deer, rabbits
and other animals that came to
eat the tender plants. What a struggle
it must have been to raise crops without
benefit of steel tools, fences, insecticides, and other advantages now
considered necessary.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Planting with sharpened stick" width="500" height="326" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The Indians farmed at the upper limit of elevations where corn,
beans, and squash may be expected to mature, because of the short growing
season, which is usually not more than 115 days. Since they had no
Weather Bureau, they may have observed the vegetation like certain
eastern Indians who watched the oaks until the first leaves were as large
as a Red Squirrel&rsquo;s foot, when they knew it was time to plant their corn.
However, there must have been unseasonal frosts such as occurred on
August 15, 1949, when present day farmers in this vicinity found their
crops severely damaged or completely ruined. Then is when the Indians
needed a reserve supply of seed for next year&rsquo;s planting.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds were also found in the dwellings, but whether these
were cultivated or gathered from wild varieties still abundant in this
vicinity is not known.</p>
<p>An understanding of the cliff dweller&rsquo;s farming activities may be
approached by studying the Hopi Indians who live on a reservation about
70 miles north of Winslow, Arizona. Most families have a farm or garden
plot where corn, beans, and squash are still the principal crops. At
Hotevilla some gardens are found on a terraced hillside, each garden with
an embankment around it to retain moisture, and producing a pattern
resembling a waffle when seen from above. Some Hopis travel four or five
miles on foot each day to cultivate their fields and return home with the
setting sun.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">THE CLIFF DWELLERS AS GATHERERS</span></h2>
<p>Wild fruits which could be gathered by the cliff dwellers include Grapes
and Elderberries, both of which are found in the canyon. There is also a
Wild Potato sometimes found in the canyon bottom. The tubers are small,
seldom as large as small cherries. Perhaps these were eaten with a seasoning
of clay, as is the Hopi custom of today. These Indians are known to eat
a salty clay with the Wild Potato and the berries of Lycium. This particular
clay counteracts the acid which would otherwise make the foods inedible.</p>
<p>Walnut Canyon produces several annual plants which could be boiled
and eaten as greens. These include Cleome or Bee Weed, Lambs Quarter,
and Mustard.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">THE CLIFF DWELLERS AS HUNTERS</span></h2>
<p>Among the trash left by these ancient people, archeologists find bones
from Deer, Antelope, Turkey, Rabbits, and various waterfowl. Present
day visitors are often delighted to see Deer or Antelope along the approach
roads to Walnut Canyon and occasionally Turkeys are seen. These are
native Wild Turkeys, which in some parts of Arizona are found in sufficient
numbers to permit a limited hunting season.</p>
<p>Animals considered good food by living Indians include Coyote, Wolf,
Fox, Dog, Wild Cat, Porcupine, Beaver, Badger, Squirrel, Gopher,
Kangaroo Rat and Pack Rat. From the available evidence, it appears that
the prehistoric cliff dwellers ate the same animals.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CONSTRUCTION OF A HOME</span></h2>
<p>Once the Indian family had selected a cave, they did very little to
enlarge it. Most of the cliff cavities are rather shallow and extend back
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
into the cliff no more than 10 to 12 feet. The cliff dwellers closed these
cavities with masonry walls and partitioned off the rooms. Walls were
constructed from rough chunks of limestone gathered wherever found.
Apparently there were no quarries. The stones were laid up to form a
double wall with the straight faces turned to the outside and the center
filled with rubble. Mud was used for both mortar and plaster; in fact most
of the mortar and plaster seen in the cliff dwellings today were produced
by the Indian builders. Because of humus and foreign matter in the soil
there is little suitable material
on the canyon ledges. However,
a layer of clay is found about
100 feet above the stream bed.
This, when pulverized and mixed
with water, would produce a
satisfactory mortar and plaster.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(after Colton)</span>
<br /><i>Door of a Cliff Dwelling Showing Smoke Hole</i></p>
</div>
<p>The rooms vary in size,
according to the amount of space
available, with an average of
about 170 square feet of floor
space. The outer wall was set
back far enough under the ledge
so that rain water running down
the cliff would drip outside the
wall. The floors were made
from hard-packed clay used in
sufficient quantity to produce a
fairly level surface. Some rooms examined in 1948 were found to have
as many as 10 thin layers, none of which exceeded three-eighths of an
inch in thickness. Each layer
was separated from the other
by accumulations of ash and
household refuse. The impression
is gained that it was
easier to lay a new floor
than it was to sweep. The
back of the cave was sometimes
higher than the front,
and often was floored separately
to form a slightly raised
platform or bench.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="small">(after Colton)</span>
<br /><i>Section of Cliff Dwelling</i></p>
</div>
<p>Little wood was used in
the construction of a home,
since the cave shelter had
a solid rock roof. There
were pole lintels over the
doors, and apparently a few
pegs were set into the walls
for supporting garments or other paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Construction tools included stone axes, hammers, and picks. In
those tools that were hafted, a groove was made three-fourths of the
way around the stone to retain a stick bent in the shape of the letter &ldquo;<span class="ss">J</span>&rdquo;
and lashed to form a handle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">COOKING</span></h2>
<p>Firepits were found in most of the dwellings. These were usually
directly in front of the door 4 or 5 feet inside the room. Smoke vents
were placed above the door at the top of the wall against the cave roof.
Not all the smoke found its way out, as can be seen where the walls and
roofs of many rooms are still heavily smoke-blackened. However, there
seems to have been a definite attempt to develop circulation of air by
adjusting the size of the smoke vent and the door opening.</p>
<p>Fires were kindled with a wooden spindle rotated on a hearth-stick
until friction ignited some tinder underneath. The spindle might be
made from Holly Grape, the hearth-stick from Yucca, and the tinder
from shredded Juniper bark.</p>
<p>Clay pots were used for cooking vessels. These were placed directly
over the fire and were able to withstand considerable heat. Some cooking
may have been done over a flat rock (or <i>comal</i>) used as a griddle, and
other foods could be broiled over the coals.</p>
<p>There was little opportunity for seasoning food. Salt could be
obtained from the Verde Valley
near Montezuma Castle about 75
miles to the south. No doubt salt
was an item of barter which was
eagerly sought, and instead of
being found in the daily diet it
may have been used almost like a
confection.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="Grinding corn" width="500" height="346" />
</div>
<p>For sweetening they may
have used Mescal (or Century
Plant). Cactus fruits and dried
squash are said to have been used.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;lemonade&rdquo; beverage could be made from the berries of Sumac
found occasionally on the Monument.</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">WHO WERE THE CLIFF DWELLERS?</span></h2>
<p>Pueblo Indians are distinguished in the Southwest by a combination
of three culture traits. These are the construction of communal
houses, the practice of agriculture, and the making of pottery. All these
traits were exhibited by the cliff dwellers in Walnut Canyon. Archeologists
designate them as the Sinagua (sih-NAH-wah), and place them
into the broad classification of the Pueblo III period which marked
the zenith of the prehistoric Pueblo culture. There are no kivas in Walnut
Canyon. The masonry is usually not coursed, perhaps because of
the rough building material available.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">WHY DID THE CLIFF DWELLERS LEAVE?</span></h2>
<p>Several forces which may have worked singly or in combination to
displace the cliff dwellers were drouth, enemy raids, and insanitary
conditions. One of the most probable causes of abandonment was drouth.
The Sinagua may have found it necessary to augment their water supply
by making earthen dams along the lower side of natural pools (particularly
farther down the canyon where it broadens). With only a slight
decline in annual precipitation the stream would fail entirely in early
summer and disrupt the entire community.</p>

below the &ldquo;Island&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>A study of the tree rings reveals that a 23-year drouth prevailed in
the Southwest from 1276 to 1299 A.D. It appears that the Walnut
Canyon cliff dwellers were gone before that time, and perhaps they
were displaced by an earlier drouth of less duration.</p>
<p>It is doubtful that the cliff dwellers perished, but rather that their
blood flows in the veins of some of the living Pueblo Indians. The Hopis
are said to have legends which indicate their ancestors once lived in cliff
caves. Hopi Indian visitors sometimes comment on the cliff dwellings
being the homes of their ancestors, and there is some evidence to support
this. Hopi Indians are of the same basic type which inhabited Walnut
Canyon. Studies made on the cliff dwellers&rsquo; physical remains reveal
they were a short, stocky people much like the Hopi of today.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">ARTS, CRAFTS, AND ORNAMENTS</span></h2>
<p>In addition to pottery making, the Indians did some weaving and
basket making. They were acquainted with cotton textiles, and since
cotton would not mature at this elevation, they must have traded for
raw cotton or the finished products. We do not know the full details
of what style clothes these people wore, but we are sure they liked shell
beads, pendants, armlets, paint of several colors, and jet buttons.</p>
<p>Turquoise was possessed by some. The nearest known sources are
several miles distant, where it was mined from solid rock with stone and
wooden tools.</p>
<p>Some shells were imported from points as distant as the Gulf of
Lower California over trade routes that have been well defined.</p>
<p>Petroglyphs are rare in the region, perhaps because of the absence
of flat sandstone on which to work. The rock pictures have been found
at only one spot in the bottom of the canyon and are few.</p>
<p>Some families may have possessed Macaws, since such bones were
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
found in other prehistoric dwellings not far away. Bones of various Owls
were found in Nalakihu, a ruin near the Citadel in Wupatki National
Monument, but only Hawk bones were found in the Winona ruins near
Walnut Canyon.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">FLORA AND FAUNA</span></h2>
<p>Walnut Canyon National Monument is at the junction of the Pine
with the Pinyon and Juniper belt. Ponderosa Pine trees grow on both
sides of the canyon and have golden brown bark. The shorter trees are
Pinyon and Juniper, four species of which are known to occur on the
Monument. There are scattered clumps of Gambel Oak, and several
perennial shrubs of smaller size. One hundred and sixty plant species
have been collected, identified, and filed in the herbarium. Several
varieties of Penstemon are seen in summer and the Evening Primrose
is common.</p>
<p>In addition to the animals mentioned elsewhere, visitors in the
warm months may see two kinds of Squirrels and numerous birds including
the Raven, Turkey Vulture, Stellar Jay, Nuthatch, and others. In
summer, lizards are common and are often found on the outside walls or
benches of the museum where they study visitors with considerable
interest.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">APPROACHES AND FACILITIES</span></h2>
<p>Walnut Canyon is located on a dirt road which forms a loop off
Highway 66. From the east the entrance gate is about 4 miles from the
paved road, and from the west about 7.</p>
<p>There are no overnight accommodations or camp ground on the
Monument, but there is a picnic area. Flagstaff, Arizona, where meals
and lodging may be had, is 12 miles from the Monument.</p>
<p>A superintendent and a ranger are in residence on the Monument,
and it is open the year around. However, the season of most desirable
weather extends from April 1 to November 1.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">PLEASE NOTICE</span></h2>
<p>Many persons visit here each day. If each will preserve the wild
flowers, and protect the ruins from defacement, Walnut Canyon will
remain a lovely place for future visitors to enjoy. For this reason it is
also asked that picnickers leave a dead fire and a clean camp in the
designated picnic area.</p>
<p>Because the wild animals&mdash;Birds, Squirrels, Foxes, Turkeys, etc.&mdash;become
tame and trusting in this, their protected refuge, domestic pets
should not be allowed to harm them, and must be kept on leash or in cars.</p>
<p>If you smoke, please be very careful while on the trail.</p>
<p>Your suggestions and cooperation will be sincerely appreciated.</p>

<p><i>This National Monument contains 1,642 acres. Most of it is forested
and at times the fire hazard is extreme. Please help us maintain
a record of no serious fires, and LET&rsquo;S KEEP IT CLEAN.</i></p>

<p>Walnut Canyon National Monument, a unit of the National Park
System, is one of the 25 National Monuments administered by the
General Superintendent, Southwestern National Monuments, National
Park Service, Department of the Interior, Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona.</p>
<p>The traveling public is becoming increasingly aware of the National
Monuments, which have received less publicity than the great, well-known
National Parks, yet which possess extremely interesting features.</p>
<p>Many of these are in the Southwest; we hope you will take the
opportunity to visit one or more of them on your trip.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
